This repository leverages [DotBot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to build out a new or existing system in a consistent way.

All information about how to navigate and read these files can be found on the DotBot repository README.

That said, all you really need to get started is to run `./install` after cloning this repository into `~/.dotfiles`.
