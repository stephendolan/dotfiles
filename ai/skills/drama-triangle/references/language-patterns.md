# Drama Triangle Language Patterns

Quick-reference for scanning communication. Organized by role.

## Rescuer/Hero Language

Reframe these toward Coach stance (believe in others' capability, ask instead of tell):

| Pattern | Reframe |
|---------|---------|
| "I got you..." | "I'm proposing..." |
| "I secured..." | "Here's what happened..." |
| "Without me..." | "Here's my contribution..." |
| "I'm the one who..." | "This is what I did..." |
| "I've been working so hard to..." | "Here's the progress..." |
| "Let me save/protect/fix..." | "Here's an option..." |
| "You need me to..." | "Would it help if I..." |
| "I'll handle this for you..." | "How would you like to approach this?" |
| "I'm protecting you from..." | "Here's what I see..." |

## Victim Language

Reframe these toward Creator stance (own your choices, focus on what you want):

| Pattern | Reframe |
|---------|---------|
| "I have no choice..." | "I'm choosing to... because..." |
| "They made me..." | "I decided to..." |
| "Given everything I've done..." | "I want..." |
| "It's not fair that..." | "I'm proposing a different structure..." |
| "I can't because..." | "Here's what I can do..." |
| "If only they would..." | "Here's what I'm asking for..." |
| "I'm forced to..." | "I'm recommending..." |
| "I've been trying to..." | "Going forward, I want to..." |

## Persecutor/Villain-Making Language

Reframe these toward Challenger stance (speak truth with care, challenge to evoke growth):

| Pattern | Reframe |
|---------|---------|
| "They're hoarding/greedy..." | "The current structure allocates X to them..." |
| "They abandoned..." | "They've stepped back from day-to-day..." |
| "They don't care..." | "Their priorities are different from mine..." |
| "They're lazy/unwilling..." | "The incentive structure doesn't align effort with reward..." |
| "Unlike them, I..." | "My approach is..." |
| "They should have..." | "Going forward, I'd like to see..." |
| "They always/never..." | "In recent situations, X has happened..." |
| "Nobody has been..." | "There's an opportunity to..." |

## Motive Attribution Check

When describing others' behavior, distinguish structure from character:

| Character attribution (avoid) | Structural observation (use) |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------|
| "They're hoarding the budget" | "The current allocation doesn't include our team" |
| "They abandoned the project" | "They've shifted focus to other priorities" |
| "The team is lazy" | "The incentive structure doesn't tie effort to outcomes" |
| "They don't trust me" | "The current structure doesn't match the responsibility level" |
| "Management doesn't care" | "This hasn't been a priority in recent planning cycles" |
| "The client is impossible" | "The client's requirements conflict with our constraints" |
