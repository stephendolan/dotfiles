# Conversation Audit Checklist

Apply this line-by-line to prepared remarks, emails, proposals, or scripts.

## The Cast Audit

For each party in the conversation:

### Party 1: _______________
- [ ] Positioned as helpless/wronged? (Victim)
- [ ] Positioned as the problem/at fault? (Villain)
- [ ] Positioned as incapable without intervention? (needs Rescuing)
- [ ] Treated as capable, with agency? (Empowered)

### Party 2: _______________
- [ ] Positioned as helpless/wronged? (Victim)
- [ ] Positioned as the problem/at fault? (Villain)
- [ ] Positioned as incapable without intervention? (needs Rescuing)
- [ ] Treated as capable, with agency? (Empowered)

### You: _______________
- [ ] Positioning myself as the savior/martyr? (Hero)
- [ ] Positioning myself as wronged/powerless? (Victim)
- [ ] Blaming others for my situation? (making Villains)
- [ ] Stating wants directly and owning my position? (Creator)

## Motive Check

For each claim about others' behavior:

1. **Am I assuming negative intent?**
   - Character: "They're hoarding" / "They abandoned" / "They don't care"
   - Structure: "The current allocation is X" / "They've shifted priorities to Y"

2. **Am I assigning character flaws or describing structure?**
   - Structure: "The current comp doesn't tie effort to outcome"
   - Character: "They're lazy and won't try unless bribed"

3. **Am I respecting their reasons even where I disagree?**
   - Respectful: "They may see this differently because..."
   - Dismissive: "They just don't get it"

## Final Check

1. **Can I state my honest want in one sentence?** Without making anyone a victim, villain, or positioning myself as hero.

2. **Am I treating everyone as capable adults?** They can evaluate this on its merits. They can handle honesty. I can ask directly.

3. **Is there mutual benefit, honestly stated?** Not "I'm sacrificing for you" but "This serves my interests AND yours."

4. **Am I willing to hear 'no'?** Hero mode needs them to need you. Victim mode needs them to rescue you. Creator mode: you want this, you've made your case, they choose.

5. **Scan for language patterns** - See `language-patterns.md` for role-specific markers to search for and reframe.
