# Drama Triangle Analysis

Analyze communication for unconscious drama roles (Victim, Persecutor, Rescuer) and reframe toward empowered alternatives (Creator, Challenger, Coach).

## The Three Drama Roles

### Victim ("Poor me")
- **Stance:** Helpless, oppressed, powerless
- **Hidden payoff:** Avoids responsibility, receives attention
- **Markers:** "I have no choice," "They made me," "I can't," "It's not fair"

### Persecutor ("It's your fault")
- **Stance:** Critical, blaming, controlling
- **Hidden payoff:** Feels powerful, deflects vulnerability
- **Markers:** "You always," "You never," "You should," "Because of them"

### Rescuer ("Let me save you")
- **Stance:** Helpful, martyred, superior-through-service
- **Hidden payoff:** Feels needed, maintains control
- **Markers:** "Without me," "I'll fix this," "You need me," "Let me handle it"

People rotate between roles within a single conversation. Rescuer becomes Victim ("After all I've done, this is how you treat me?"), Victim becomes Persecutor ("I've suffered enough, now it's YOUR turn"). The rotation is the signal - when someone shifts roles mid-conversation, they're in the triangle.

## The Empowered Alternative (TED)

| Drama Role | Empowered Role | The Shift |
|------------|----------------|-----------|
| Victim | **Creator** | "What do I want? What can I create?" |
| Persecutor | **Challenger** | "I challenge you to grow" (with respect) |
| Rescuer | **Coach** | "What do YOU see? How can I support YOUR solution?" |

**Creator** focuses on outcomes and owns choices. **Challenger** speaks truth with care and holds accountability without blame. **Coach** believes in others' capability and asks questions instead of giving answers.

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Identify the Cast

For each party in the communication, determine which role they've been assigned:
- Who is positioned as helpless or wronged? (Victim)
- Who is positioned as the problem? (Persecutor)
- Who is positioned as the savior? (Rescuer)
- Which role is the author implicitly claiming?

### Step 2: Check for Role Rotation

Look for statements that shift between roles in the same communication:
- "After everything I've done [Rescuer], this is how they treat me [Victim]"
- "I've been patient [Rescuer], but now I have to be blunt [Persecutor]"

### Step 3: Find Hidden Payoffs

For each role assignment, evaluate what it accomplishes:
- Does it avoid accountability?
- Does it create false urgency or dependency?
- Does it diminish someone's agency?

### Step 4: Reframe to Empowerment

Rewrite each drama-laden statement using Creator/Challenger/Coach stance:

| Instead of... | Use... |
|---------------|--------|
| "I got you this" | "I'm proposing this" |
| "They won't unless..." | "This creates alignment" |
| "You have to because..." | "Here's why this works" |
| "I'm the only one who..." | "Here's my contribution" |
| "They abandoned/hoarded/failed" | "The current structure is X. I'm proposing Y." |
| "I deserve / I've earned" | "I'm proposing... because..." |
| "Without me, this would..." | "Here's what I want to build..." |
| "I need..." | "I'm proposing..." |

### Step 5: Apply the One-Liner Test

The author should be able to state their core message without making anyone a victim, making anyone a villain, or positioning themselves as the hero.

**Drama version:** "I fought to get the team this raise from management, who've been hoarding the budget."
**Clean version:** "I'm proposing we restructure comp because aligned incentives drive better outcomes."

## For Conversation Prep

Before a difficult conversation, evaluate:

1. **Am I making anyone a victim?** (including myself)
2. **Am I assigning villain motives?** (greed, laziness, abandonment)
3. **Am I positioning myself as the hero?** (savior, martyr, only solution)
4. **What's my honest want?** (state it in one sentence)
5. **How do I respect everyone's agency?** (they can choose, they're capable)
6. **What's the mutual benefit framing?** (not "I'm sacrificing for you")
