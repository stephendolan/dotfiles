# Create Pull Request

Create a high-quality PR for the current branch with a clear, concise description.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Branch Changes

Run in parallel:

```bash
git diff main...HEAD --stat    # Summary of all changes
git log main..HEAD --oneline   # Commit history on this branch
git status                     # Check if pushed to remote
```

### 2. Understand the Why

Before drafting, identify:

- **What problem does this solve?** (user-facing issue or business need)
- **Why was this approach chosen?** (if non-obvious)

If the problem isn't clear from commit messages or code, **ask the user**. Never guess.

### 3. Draft Description

```markdown
## Summary

[2-3 sentences: what changed and why]

## Problem

[1-2 sentences: the user-facing issue or business need this solves]

---
Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)
```

Only add a **Core Changes** section for:
- Breaking API changes
- New database migrations
- Major architectural modifications
- New service integrations

### 4. Create PR

```bash
# Push if needed
git push -u origin HEAD

# Create PR (add --draft if requested)
gh pr create --title "type(scope): summary" --body "..."
```

Report the PR URL when complete.

## What to Include

- Summary (2-3 sentences max)
- Problem statement (verify with user if uncertain)
- Core changes (only for major architectural work)

## What to Exclude

- Technical details sections
- Testing sections (CI handles this)
- Before/after comparisons
- File listings (visible in diff)
- Migration notes (unless critical)
- Follow-up work sections

## Key Principles

- **Why over what**: The diff shows what changed; explain why
- **Trust CI/CD**: Don't document what automated tests verify
- **Brevity**: Two sections (Summary + Problem) is normal and sufficient
- **Question uncertainty**: Always verify problem statements you're unsure about
