# Commit Changes

Create a high-quality commit with a message that captures the intent, not just the mechanics.

## Process

### 1. Analyze Changes

Run in parallel:

```bash
git diff --cached              # Staged changes (or git diff if nothing staged)
git status                     # What's changed
git log --oneline -5           # Match repository style
```

### 2. Understand the Why

Before writing the message, identify:

- **What problem does this solve?**
- **Why was this change necessary?**
- **What decision was made?** (if alternatives existed)

The diff shows *what* changed. The message explains *why*.

### 3. Draft Message

```
type(scope): concise summary in imperative mood

Optional body explaining WHY this change was made.
Not what changed (the diff shows that), but why.

```

### 4. Refine and Commit

Before committing, verify:

- Type accurately reflects the change
- Summary is specific, not vague
- Every word earns its place
- Imperative mood ("add" not "added")
- Under 72 characters

```bash
git add [files]  # Stage if needed
git commit -m "..."
```

## Commit Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `feat` | New feature or functionality |
| `fix` | Bug fix |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring (no behavior change) |
| `docs` | Documentation only |
| `chore` | Maintenance, dependencies, config |
| `test` | Adding or modifying tests |
| `perf` | Performance improvements |

## Message Quality

**Good**: Explains intent
```
feat(auth): add rate limiting to login endpoint

Prevents brute-force attacks by limiting attempts per IP.
```

**Bad**: Just describes the diff
```
feat(auth): add rate limiter middleware and config
```

**Good**: Specific
```
fix(api): handle null response from payment provider
```

**Bad**: Vague
```
fix(api): fix bug
```

## When to Add a Body

Add a body when:
- The *why* isn't obvious from the summary
- You chose between multiple approaches
- There's important context for future readers
- Breaking changes need explanation

## Scope Guidelines

Include scope when changes focus on a specific module. Skip when changes span multiple areas or scope is obvious from context.

```
feat(auth): add OAuth2 provider
fix(api): handle null response
refactor(database): normalize user schema
chore: update dependencies
```

## Key Principles

- **Why over what**: The diff shows what; the message explains why
- **Concise**: Every word must earn its place
- **Imperative**: "add feature" not "added feature"
- **Specific**: "fix login validation" not "fix bug"
- **Match style**: Check `git log` and follow existing patterns
