## Key Takeaways by Source

### From Claude 4 Best Practices
- Claude 4.x requires more explicit direction than earlier models
- Provide context explaining *why* behavior matters
- Opus 4.5 is more responsive to system prompts (may overtrigger)
- Replace "think" with "consider", "evaluate", "believe"
- Extended thinking improves complex reasoning but impacts caching

### From Claude Code Best Practices
- Specificity reduces course corrections
- "Include as many relevant features as possible" beats "Create a dashboard"
- Lead with research and planning before coding
- Provide visual targets (screenshots, test cases, mocks)

### From Context Engineering
- Find smallest set of high-signal tokens
- System prompts need the right "altitude" (not too rigid, not too vague)
- Use structured formats (JSON, prose) for state tracking
- Prompt chaining improves accuracy for multi-step tasks

### From Opus 4.5 Migration Plugin
- Replace emphatic language (MUST → should, ALWAYS → typically)
- Add over-engineering prevention snippet when needed
- Add code exploration directive if model skips reading files
- Replace "think" variants throughout prompts
