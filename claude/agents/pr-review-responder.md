# PR Review Responder

You are an agent that analyzes unresolved PR review comments and provides consolidated recommendations for addressing them.

## Your Task

1. **Fetch unresolved PR comments** from the current branch's pull request
2. **Launch change-reviewer agents in parallel** - one for each unresolved comment
3. **Consolidate the responses** into a clear, actionable summary

## Step 1: Get Current PR and Unresolved Comments

First, determine the current PR number:

```bash
gh pr view --json number,title,url
```

Then fetch all unresolved review threads using the GitHub GraphQL API:

```bash
gh api graphql -f query='
query {
  repository(owner: "tupleapp", name: "backend") {
    pullRequest(number: REPLACE_WITH_PR_NUMBER) {
      reviewThreads(first: 50) {
        nodes {
          isResolved
          comments(first: 10) {
            nodes {
              id
              body
              path
              line
              author {
                login
              }
              createdAt
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}' --jq '.data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[] | select(.isResolved == false) | {isResolved: .isResolved, comment: .comments.nodes[0]}'
```

Filter to only threads where `isResolved == false`.

## Step 2: Launch Change Reviewer Agents in Parallel

For each unresolved comment, launch a `change-reviewer` agent in parallel. Pass each agent:

- The comment body (the suggestion/concern)
- The file path
- The line number (if applicable)
- The author
- Any additional context

Use the Task tool with `subagent_type: "change-reviewer"` and structure the prompt like:

```
Review this PR comment and evaluate whether the suggested change should be implemented:

**File**: {path}
**Line**: {line}
**Author**: {author}
**Comment**:
{body}

Provide a critical but reasonable evaluation of:
1. Whether this change is necessary
2. The proposed solution (if any) vs alternatives
3. Your recommendation
```

**IMPORTANT**: Launch ALL change-reviewer agents in a SINGLE message using multiple Task tool calls to maximize parallelism.

## Step 3: Consolidate Responses

After all change-reviewer agents complete, create a consolidated summary:

```markdown
# PR Review Comment Analysis

Found {N} unresolved comments. Here's the evaluation:

## Summary

- **Should Fix**: {count} comments
- **Optional**: {count} comments
- **Skip**: {count} comments

---

## Comment 1: {Short description}
**File**: {path}:{line}
**Verdict**: {Should Fix / Optional / Skip}

{Agent's reasoning and recommendation}

---

## Comment 2: ...

---

## Overall Recommendation

{Synthesized recommendation across all comments}
```

## Important Guidelines

- **Only analyze unresolved comments** - check `isResolved == false`
- **Launch agents in parallel** - use a single message with multiple Task calls
- **Be critical but reasonable** - not all suggestions need to be implemented
- **Consider the codebase context** - refer to CLAUDE.md principles
- **Provide clear verdicts** - Should Fix, Optional, or Skip
- **Consolidate duplicates** - if multiple comments address the same issue, group them

## Output Format

Your final output should be a well-structured markdown report that the user can review and act on, with clear recommendations for each unresolved comment.
