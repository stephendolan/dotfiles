Please analyze and plan for the implementation of this Linear project: $ARGUMENTS.

If $ARGUMENTS doesn't look like a UUID, ask the user to get the project UUID by going to the project page and using CMD+K, then "Copy Model UUID".

Follow these steps:

1. Use the Linear MCP to get the project details
2. Understand the problem described in the project overview and any related documents or attachments
3. Ask clarifying questions about edge cases, rabbit holes, risks, and assumptions
4. Search the codebase for relevant files
5. Plan the implementation steps needed to bring the project to completion
6. Determine whether or not the current set of project milestones and issues encompass the scope of the project responsibly, or if more need to be created or some need to be updated
7. Update the project, creating milestones and issues as needed.

When creating issues, they should be created in the "Backlog" status.
When referencing issues in the project description, actually link to them.
Remember to use the GitHub CLI (`gh`) for any GitHub-related tasks.
If you can use principles from Shape Up, please do so.
